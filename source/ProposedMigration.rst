==================
Proposed Migration
==================

Uploads of fixed or merged packages don't automatically get released to Ubuntu
users, but rather go into a special pocket called 'proposed' for testing and
integration.  Once a package is deemed ok, it 'migrates' into the release
pocket for users to consume.  This is called the `"Proposed Migration"
process`_.

Here is the typical lifecycle for an upload:

0. Issue identified, fixed, and packaged

1. source.changes uploaded

2. If the fix is an SRU, or if we're in a freeze_:

   *  Upload goes into an 'unapproved' queue

   *  SRU team reviews and approves... (goto 3)

   *  ...or disapproves (goto 0)

3. Upload goes into [codename]-proposed queue

4. Launchpad builds binary package(s) from source package

5. Run `autopkgtests`_

   * Autopkgtests for the package itself

   * Autopkgtests for the reverse{-build}-dependencies, as well

6. Verify other archive consistency checks

   *  Are binary packages installable?

   *  Are all required dependencies at the right version?

   *  Does it cause anything to become uninstallable?

   *  etc.

7. If (and only if) the fix is an SRU:

   * `SRU bug`_ updated with request to verify

   *  Reporter or developer verifies fix, and updates tags

8. Release package from ``[codename]-proposed`` to ``[codename]``

Often the migration proceeds automatically, but when there are issues our
involvement is needed to sort things out.  Sometimes the package having the
problem is one we've uploaded ourselves, so naturally want to work on solving
the issue.  But in other times the issue arises organically such as via
something that auto-sync'd from Debian, or a side-effect from some other change
in the distro, and thus have no defined "owner".  For these latter problems
(and for the former when they've become tricky), the Ubuntu project requires
some of its distro developers to devote a portion of their time to focusing on
migration issues generally, on a rotating basis each working a few days or week
at a time.

Following are tips and tricks for solving migration issues, and some guidance
for people just starting the proposed migration duty.

Update Excuses Page
-------------------

All current migration issues for the current devel release are displayed on the
`Update Excuses Page`_. `Similar pages`_ exist for stable releases (these items
generally relate to particular SRUs).  These pages are created by a software
service named "Britney", which updates the page after each batch of test runs,
typically every 2-3 hours depending on load.

The page is ordered newest to oldest, and so the items at the top of the page
may still be processing (indicated by "Test in progress" marked for one or more
architectures).  In general, two things to watch for are "missing build", which
can indicate a failure to build the source package (FTBFS), and "autopkgtest
Regression", which indicates a test failure.  Both of these situations are
described in more depth below.

Many of the items on the page are not actually broken, they're just blocked by
something else that needs resolution.  This often happens for new libraries or
language runtimes, or really any package that a lot of other things depend on
to build, install, or run tests against.

If you are just coming up to speed on proposed migration duty, you'll likely be
wondering "Where do I even start?!"  A good suggestion is to look for build
failures towards the upper-middle of the page affecting only one architecture;
single-arch build failures tend to be more localized and more deterministic as
to cause, and items towards the top of the page but after all the "Test in
progress" items will have had fewer eyeballs on them since they're newer, and
so have a higher chance of being something simple, yet not so new that it's
still being actively worked on by someone.  If you suspect there may already be
eyeballs on the issue, the #ubuntu-devel IRC channel can be a good place to ask
if anyone's already looking at it.

But don't worry too much about where to start; the Update Excuses page is much
like a wool sweater in that you start pulling at one thread and end up
unraveling the whole affair.


Bug Reports for Migration Problems
----------------------------------

If you file a bug report about a build or test failure shown on the update
excuses page, tag the bug report ``update-excuse``.  Britney will include a
link to the bug report next time it refreshes the update_excuses.html page.
This helps other developers see the investigation work you've already done, and
can be used to identify the next-action.  Mark yourself as the Assignee if
you're actively working on the issue, and leave the bug unsubscribed if you
aren't so that others can carry things forward.



Failure to Build From Source (FTBFS)
------------------------------------

The build step can hit failures for several general classes of problems.  First
are regular build problems that can be easily reproduced locally (and that
should have been addressed before uploading).  Second are platform-specific
issues that may have been overlooked due to being present only on unfamiliar
hardware.  Third are intermittent network or framework problems, where simply
retrying the build once or twice can result in a successful build.  Fourth are
dependency problems, where the task is to get some other package to be the
right version in the release pocket so that the build will succeed.  Fifth are
ABI changes with dependencies; these often just need a no-change rebuild.  And
last are all the other myriad package-specific build problems, that typically
require some particular tweak to the package itself.

The first case covers all the usual normal build issues like syntax errors and
so on.  In practice these are typically quite rare because developers tend to
be very diligent at making sure their packages build before uploading.  Fixes
for these is the usual standard development work.

The second case is similar to the first but pertains to issues that arise only
on specific platforms.  Common situations are tests or code that relies on
`endianness`_ of data types and so breaks on big-endian systems (e.g. s390x),
code expecting 64-bit data types that breaks on 32-bit (e.g. armhf), and so on.
`Canonistack provides hardware`_ that Canonical employees can use to attempt
reproduction of these problems. Take note with i386 particularly in that it
often fails less due to data type issues but more because it is a partial port
and has numerous limitations that require special handling, as described on the
`i386 troubleshooting page`_.

In the third case, local building was fine but the uploaded build may have
failed on Launchpad due to a transitory issue such as a network outage, or a
race condition, or other stressed resource.  Or it might have failed due to a
strange dependence on some variable like the day of the week.  In these cases,
clicking on the "Retry Build" button in Launchpad once or twice can sometimes
cause the build to randomly succeed, thus allowing the transition to proceed
(if you're not yet a core-dev, ask for a core-dev on the #ubuntu-devel IRC
channel if they can click the link for you).  Needless to say, we don't wish
for such unpredictabilities in the build process, so if the problem reoccurs
and if you can narrow down the cause, it can be worthwhile to find the root
cause and figure out how to fix it properly.

For the fourth case, where a dependency is not the right version or is not
present in the right pocket, the question becomes one of identifying what's
wrong with the dependency and fixing it.  Be aware there may be some situations
where the problem really is with the dependency itself, and the solution is to
change the version of the dependency, or adjust the dependency version
requirement, or removing invalid binary packages, or so forth.  These latter
solutions often require asking for an archive admin's help on the
#ubuntu-release IRC channel.

The fifth case of ABI changes comes up particularly when Ubuntu is introducing
new versions of toolchains, language runtime environments or core libraries;
i.e. new glibc, gcc, glib2.0, ruby, python3, phpunit, et al.  This happens when
the release of the underlying libraries/toolchain is newer than the consuming
project.  Your package may fail to build because one of its dependencies was
built against a different version of glibc, or with less strict gcc options
`Ubuntu Defaults can be checked here`_, or whatever, and needs (no-change)
rebuilt (and/or patched) to build with the new version or stricter options.
Assuming the upstream project has already made the changes to adapt to the
changed behavior or function-prototypes and produced a release, then if we
already have that release in Ubuntu a simple no-change rebuild may suffice; if
we don't have the release, then it will take a sync or merge, or patching in
the changes to what we're carrying.  If upstream has not released the changes,
then you could also consider packaging a snapshot of their git repo.  If
upstream has not yet made the changes, and there aren't already existing bug
reports or pull requests, it may be necessary to make the changes on our end.
Communication with Debian and upstream can be effective here, and where it
isn't filing bug reports can be worth the effort.

With this fifth case, it's worth noting that quite often these updates cause
the same kind of errors in many places.  It's worth asking in the #ubuntu-devel
IRC channel in case standard solutions are already known that you can re-use,
such as ignoring a new warning via a ``-W...`` option or switching to the old
behavior via a ``-f...`` option.  It's also worth reporting your findings in
ways others can easily re-use when they run into more cases.

Finally, there are also a miscellania of other problems that can result in
build failures.  Many of these will be package-specific or situation-specific.
As you run into situations that crop up more than a couple times please update
these docs.


Autopkgtest Regressions
-----------------------

After a package has successfully built, the `autopkgtest infrastructure`_ will
run its `DEP8 tests`_ for each of its supported architectures.  Failed tests
can block the migration, and "Regression" listed for the failed
architecture(s).

You can view the recent test run history for a package's architecture by
clicking on the respective architecture's name.

Tests can fail for myriad reasons.

Flaky tests, hardware instabilities, and intermittent network issues can cause
false positive failures.  A simple retriggering of the test run (via the '♻ '
symbol) is typically all that's needed to resolve these.  Before doing this, it
is worthwhile to check the recent test run history to see if someone else has
already tried.

When examining a failed autopkgtest's log, start from the end of the file,
which typically will either show a summary of the test runs, or an error
message if a fault was hit.  For example::

    done.
    done.
    (Reading database ... 50576 files and directories currently installed.)
    Removing autopkgtest-satdep (0) ...
    autopkgtest [21:40:55]: test command1: true
    autopkgtest [21:40:55]: test command1: [-----------------------
    autopkgtest [21:40:58]: test command1: -----------------------]
    command1             PASS
    autopkgtest [21:41:03]: test command1:  - - - - - - - - - - results - - - - - - - - - -
    autopkgtest [21:41:09]: @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ summary
    master-cron-systemd  FAIL non-zero exit status 1
    master-cgi-systemd   PASS
    node-systemd         PASS
    command1             PASS

Here we see that the test named 'master-cron-systemd' has failed.  To see why
it failed, do a search on the page for 'master-cron-systemd', and iterate until
you get to the last line of the testrun, then scroll up to find the failed test
cases::

    autopkgtest [21:23:39]: test master-cron-systemd: preparing testbed
    ...
    ...
    autopkgtest [21:25:10]: test master-cron-systemd: [-----------------------
    ...
    ...
    not ok 3 - munin-html: no files in /var/cache/munin/www/ before first run
    #
    #	  find /var/cache/munin/www/ -mindepth 1 >unwanted_existing_files
    #	  test_must_be_empty unwanted_existing_files
    #
    ...
    ...
    autopkgtest [21:25:41]: test master-cron-systemd: -----------------------]
    master-cron-systemd  FAIL non-zero exit status 1
    autopkgtest [21:25:46]: test master-cron-systemd:  - - - - - - - - - - results - - - - - - - - - -
    autopkgtest [21:25:46]: test master-cron-systemd:  - - - - - - - - - - stderr - - - - - - - - - -
    rm: cannot remove '/var/cache/munin/www/localdomain/localhost.localdomain': Directory not empty

All autopkgtests follow this general format, although the output from the tests
themselves varies widely.

Beyond "regular" test case failures like this one, autopkgtest failures can
also occur due to missing or incorrect dependencies, test framework timeouts,
and other issues.  Each of these is discussed in more detail below.


Test Dependency Irregularities
------------------------------

The package's `debian/tests/control file defines what gets installed`_ in the
test environment before executing the tests.  You can review and verify the
packages and versions in the DEP8 test log, between the lines 'autopkgtest...:
test integration: preparing testbed' and 'Removing autopkgtest-satdep'.

A common issue is that the test should be run against a version of a dependency
present in the -proposed pocket, however it failed due to running against the
version in -release.  Often this is straightforward to prove by running the
autopkgtests locally in a container.  Another easy way to test this is to
re-run the test but set it to preferentially pull packages from -proposed --
this is done by appending '&all-proposed=1' to the test URL.  If that passes,
but the package still does not migrate, then look in the test log for all
packages that were pulled from -proposed and include those as triggers.
`Excuses Kicker`_ and `retry-autopkgtest-regressions`_ are handy tools for
generating these URLs.

As with rebuilds, these retriggers also require core-dev permissions, so if
you're not yet core-dev give the links to someone who is for assistance.


Test Framework Timeouts and Out of Memory
-----------------------------------------

The autopkgtest framework will kill tests that take too long to run.  In some
cases it makes sense to just configure autopkgtest to let the test run longer.
This is done by setting the ```long_tests``` option.  Similarly, some tests may
need more CPU or memory than in a standard worker.  The ```big_packages```
option directs autopkgtest to run these on workers with more CPU and memory.
Both these options and the effective memory/cpu sizes are explained on the
`ProposedMigration`_ page. It is worth to mention that Debian test sizing is
currently (as of 2021) equivalent to our big_packages.

The configuration that associates source packages to either ``big_packages`` /
``long_tests`` and the actual deployment code was recently split. `The new
docs`_ explain this and link `a repository`_ which is now mergeable by any
release team member.


Other Common Issues
-------------------

Autopkgtest runs tests in a controlled network environment, so if a test case
expects to download material from the internet, it will likely fail.  If the
test case is attempting to download a dependency (e.g. via PIP or Maven),
sometimes this can be worked around by adding the missing dependency to
``debian/tests/control``.  If it is attempting to download an example file,
then it may be possible to make the test case use a local file, or to load from
the proxy network.


Skipping tests
--------------

If an autopkgtest is badly written, it may be too challenging to get it to
pass.  In these extreme cases, its possible to request that test failures be
ignored for purposes of package migration.

Checkout `lp:~ubuntu-release/britney/hints-ubuntu`_

File a MP against it with a description indicating the lp bug#, rationale for
why the test can and should be skipped, and explanation of what will be
unblocked to migration.

Reviewers should be 'canonical-server', 'ubuntu-release', and any archive
admins or foundations team members you've discussed the issue with.

Please be aware that some old docs or habits might mislead you. The most common
hint used to be "force-badtest" to mark one bad, which was superseded by the
more useful 'force-reset' allowing results to come back to be good without
further action on the hints. But even that recently got replaced by
``migration-reference/0``. It essentially allows the functionality of
``force-reset`` without needing to bother the release team. See `here for
details`_.


Excuse Glossary
---------------

Migration status for aaa (x to y)
  This means package "aaa" has a new version y uploaded to -proposed, to
  replace the existing version x, but the change has not yet been
  permitted.


Issues preventing migration
  This heading marks the start of a list of verdicts decided by
  britney2 about why the package should not be permitted.  This list
  ends at the 'Additional info:' heading.


Impossible <deptype>: aaa -> bbb/x/arch
  Package 'aaa' has a dependency on package 'bbb', version x, for
  architecture 'arch', but it is not possible to satisfy this.


Invalidated by <deptype>
  The package had a dependency that itself was not a valid migration
  candidate.


Implicit dependency: aaa <bbb>
  An implicit dependency is a pseudo dependency where Breaks/Conflicts
  creates an inverted dependency.  For example, pkg-b Depends on pkg-a,
  but pkg-a=2.0-1 breaks pkg-b=1.0-1, so pkg-b=2.0-1 must migrate first
  (or they must migrate together).  A way to handle this is to re-run
  pkg-b's autopkgtest (for 2.0-1) and include a trigger for pkg-a=2.0.

  This can also occur if pkg-b has "Depends: pkg-a (<< 2.0)", due to use
  of some non-stable internal interface.

  It can also occur if pkg-a has a Provides that changes from 1.0-1 to
  2.0-1, but pkg-b has a Depends on the earlier version.


Implicit dependency: aaa <bbb> (not considered)
  Similar to above, "aaa" and "bbb" are intertwined, but "bbb" is also
  either invalid or rejected.  For these cases, attention should first
  go to resolving the issue(s) for "bbb", and then re-running the
  autopkgtest for it with a trigger included against package "aaa".


Depends: aaa <bbb>
  Package "aaa" is blocked because it depends on "bbb" which has not yet
  migrated.


Depends: aaa <bbb> (not considered)
  Package "aaa" is blocked because it depends on "bbb", however "bbb" is
  either invalid or rejected.  If the dependency itself is not valid,
  this line will be followed by an 'Invalidated by dependency' line.

  There are three reasons why a rejection can occur:  a) it needs
  approval, b) cannot determine if permanent, or c) permanent rejection.


Has no binaries on arch <xyz>
  Usually this means the package has either failed to build or failed to
  upload the binaries for a build.  The FTBFS section (above) covers how
  to handle this class of problem.

  Packages that fail on a single arch can be great candidates for
  debugging and resolving, since the failures are more likely to be
  limited in scope and reproducible either locally or via Canonistack.


Has no binaries on any arch (- to x.y.z)
  If the package doesn't have a current version, this error can indicate
  the package is not (yet) in the archive, or it can mean its binaries
  were removed previously but not sync-blacklisted and thus reappeared.

  If the package should not be sync'd into the archive, on
  #ubuntu-release ping "ubuntu-archive" with request to remove the
  packages' binaries and add them to sync-blacklist.txt

  Otherwise, there are several things worth checking:

  Stuck in New queue?
    ``https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/<codename>/+queue?queue_state=0``

  Stuck in Unapproved queue?
    ``https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/<codename>/+queue?queue_state=1``

  Main/Universe component mismatch?
    If blocked package is in main, but new dependency is in universe, then will
    need to file a MIR.

    + https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.txt

    + https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArchiveAdministration#Component_Mismatches_and_Changing_Overrides

    + See: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MainInclusionProcess

    + One very special case of these is unintended dependencies due to
      extra-includes. Please be aware that while most Dependencies seem obvious
      (Seeds -> packages -> packages) there is an aspect of germinate which
      will `automatically include`_ all -dbg, -dev, -doc* packages in a source
      archive that is in main. In `Germinate`_ these will appear as ``Rescued
      from <src>``. In case a merge is affected, the solution without adding
      delta usually is to add an ``Extra-exclude`` like in this `example with
      net-snmp`_.

  Circular Test Dependencies
    If several related packages are attempting to sync, which depend on
    each other, they may be blocked simply due to needing the -proposed
    versions of their dependencies.  In this case, a properly crafted
    retrigger may be worth attempting.

  Circular Build Dependencies
    Similarly, a package may depend on -proposed versions of another
    package to _build_... and that second package depends directly or
    indirectly on the -proposed version of the first package.  These are
    trickier to sort out
