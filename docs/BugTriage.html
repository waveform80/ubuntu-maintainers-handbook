<h1>Bug Triage<a class="headerlink" href="#bug-triage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>New bugs get reported every day, and existing tickets in Launchpad get updated
with comments, patches, and status changes.  The triager’s job is to review the
traffic, deal with invalid or trivial issues, ignore stuff that’s just noise,
and flag items of importance, urgency, and/or readiness.</p>
<p>Triaging work is shared across the team, with the goal of successfully
reviewing every bug filed against Ubuntu Server related packages.  Each
triaging session will focus on a subset of tickets that changed during a
specific time period, such as the previous day.  The triager isn’t responsible
for solving the reported problem, just to ensure it is getting appropriate
attention it needs.</p>
<p>All newly reported issues will need a triager’s review.  A review involves
analyzing a bug to determine if the bug is valid and if sufficient information
was provided, and then marking it ‘Triaged’.  Otherwise, it’s set to a more
appropriate state with a comment explaining why, and what next actions are, if
any.</p>
<p>Older issues generally require no triager action if they’re progressing through
their normal workflow. But watch for comments providing new information that
may make the issue more actionable.</p>
<div class="section" id="types-of-issue-tickets">
<h2>Types of Issue Tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-issue-tickets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Items in the triaging queue tend to fall into a few categories, that are
handled in different ways:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Process Tickets</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Bug reports are often used to track status of packaging workflow tasks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sync requests</li>
<li>Merge requests</li>
<li>Stable release updates (SRU)</li>
<li>Main Inclusion Requests (MIR)</li>
<li>Freeze exception request (FFe, UI-FFe, et al.)</li>
<li>Package promotion/demotion (“Seed management/changes”)</li>
</ul>
<p class="last">These will generally either be filed by or assigned to a team member; if not,
investigate further.  Generally, for properly owned tickets ‘No action is
required’ by the triager, unless something unusually weird is going on in
which case ‘Raise with the Team’ (that <em>raising</em> can be “bringing it up in
post-standup”, “bringing it up in the weekly bug meeting” or “bringing it up
in a chat channel pinging related developers” TL;DR do not stay alone with
the weirdness - group experience and group decisions win).</p>
</dd>
<dt>SRU Regression Bugs</dt>
<dd>Problems that look like the result of an SRU update to a server package need
to receive top priority.  For such bugs, ‘Add to Server-Next Queue’ and
‘Raise with the Team’.  If possible, verify rolling back to the prior version
of the package fixes the issue, and re-installing the update brings the issue
back. In this case, also tag the bug ‘regression-update’.  Be aware that bugs
are sometimes described as regressions simply because they’re new to the
user, not due to being actually introduced from an SRU update. For example,
the user could have had a bad config file already, but the SRU triggers a
restart of the service an that’s when the user notices the problem and files
a bug, thinking it was the update that introduced it.</dd>
<dt>Severe Bugs</dt>
<dd>Urgently important issues such as ones with potential for widespread
breakage, should immediately ‘Add to Server-Next Queue’.</dd>
<dt>High Profile Bugs</dt>
<dd>Issues which involve an important customer or VIP, or that turn up frequently
in search results, can generate a lot of “repeat visits” so to speak.  Just
‘Raise issue with the team’, unless its already well known in which case ‘No
action required’ by the triager.</dd>
<dt>Support Requests</dt>
<dd>Sometimes users report problems that are really just a misunderstanding of
how to use their system.  Kindly redirect them to more appropriate venues for
help, and/or lend any obvious advice, but otherwise close the ticket as
“Invalid” due to being ‘Not a Bug’.</dd>
<dt>Unclear</dt>
<dd>If the ticket is missing log files, version details, or other information
necessary to decide how to handle the bug, ask the user for what’s needed,
set the ticket to “Incomplete” due to ‘Not Enough Info.’</dd>
<dt>Duplicate</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If the issue is clearly the same as another report</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>mark one as duplicate of the better reported (or older) issue.</li>
<li>If there are existing tickets that sound very similar, make sure
they are mentioned in a comment.  Ask the reporter(s) to review
those and identify if it is indeed a dupe, or if not to then
elaborate on how this new one differs.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Non-actionable Comment</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If an existing ticket pops up in the queue due to a comment, check if it is
adding information.</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>If it’s just noise (e.g. “me too!”), ‘No action is required’ by the
triager.</li>
<li>If it seems to describe a legitimate problem, but one completely
unrelated to the originally reported issue, recommend filing a new
bug report.</li>
<li>Otherwise suggest logical next steps, to put current interest to
work at helping the bug make forward progress.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Unreproducible Bug</dt>
<dd>If the issue can’t be reproduced (e.g. in an lxc container) then request the
reporter provide the ‘Missing Steps to Reproduce’ it.</dd>
<dt>Reproducible Bug</dt>
<dd>If there seems to be enough information to reproduce the bug, try to do so in
an lxc container, and then itemize the steps to follow, and how to identify
that the bug has indeed occurred.  If it all looks good, subscribe the server
team, or if the issue looks urgent and/or important ‘Add to Server-Next
Queue’.</dd>
<dt>Already Fixed in Development</dt>
<dd><p class="first">An issue that can be reproduced in a supported Ubuntu release, but not in the
current development version of Ubuntu, may qualify for SRU processing.</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>Make sure the reproduction steps are clearly outlined</li>
<li>If the issue is minor/trivial, it probably won’t be worth SRUing, so should
be closed as already fixed in development.</li>
<li>If the issue is a request for a feature (not a bug fix), it may not qualify
as eligible for SRU.  If that’s the case, either close it as fixed in
development, or add bug tasks for the requested releases set as ‘Wishlist’,
and close the main bug task as fixed.</li>
<li>If the issue is a bug fix and looks important, then determine which
supported Ubuntu releases will need the fix and add Bug Tasks as
appropriate.  Even though the issue is fixed in the development, leave the
main task <em>open</em> in this case because otherwise Launchpad may not display
it in reports and lists.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Already Fixed in Debian</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If the issue has been solved in Debian, it will likely be worth merging
and/or sru’ing the fix.</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>Make sure steps to reproduce it are identified.</li>
<li>If the issue affects the development release, it is a merge opportunity.
If past feature-freeze, decide if is it worth a freeze exception.  Make
sure there is a merge bug in launchpad for the package, and consider to Add
to Server-Next/Server-Todo Queue.</li>
<li>If the issue affects a stable release and looks SRU-worthy, determine which
supported Ubuntu releases will need the fix and add Bug Tasks as
appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Already Fixed Upstream</dt>
<dd><p class="first">All the steps of the “already fixed in Debian” category above apply, here as
well -  in addition, help Debian when appropriate by:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>filing a Debian bug about it or chime in if there is an existing one</li>
<li>If you create a PR for Ubuntu that can be used almost as-is consider
sending one via salsa as well</li>
<li>Aligning our solution with Debian not only is kind, but additionally helps
to avoid long term complex divergence and delta</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Unclear</dt>
<dd>If in doubt or none of the above applies consider bringing it up via chat or
if looking for a group discussion and decision tag it
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-triage-discuss</span></code>. Those bugs we will try to resolve together in our
weekly meeting.</dd>

<div class="section" id="special-cases">
<h3>Special cases<a class="headerlink" href="#special-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A few of our packages have common issue patterns or best practise triaging
actions. This section shall list them so that anyone on triage duty can find
all of it in one place.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Mysql</dt>
<dd><p class="first">MySQL often has low quality bug reports by users not fully aware which
dependency brought it onto their system. Those often fall into a few common
usage errors.  Furthermore there are a few long standing issues that affect
many users but often are reported as new.</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Due to that we’ve found that quite often as a first step in triaging
mysql one might want to check for duplicates.<ul>
<li>In the days of mysql-5.7 (Xenial/Bionic) we tagged the common core bugs
that one would dup new bugs to, those are available as <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mysql-5.7/+bugs?&amp;field.tag=triage">mysql-5.7

<li>Since mysql-8.0 we no more use that tag, instead it turned out to be
more reliable to just look at recent <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mysql-8.0/+bugs?orderby=-heat&amp;start=0">mysql-8.0 bugs by heat</a> to spot
the duplication candidates</li>

<li>If not a duplicate, then still please update the bug title from the usual

better recognizing the issue in any kind of overview that just lists the

<dt>Virtualization controlled through libvirt</dt>
<dd>If these reports are about the inability to access devices or <em>permission
denied</em> issues the user often does not realize that libvirt applies an

for apparmor denials at the time the problem triggers.</dd>

<h3>Direct team subscriptions<a class="headerlink" href="#direct-team-subscriptions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We subscribe <em>~ubuntu-server</em> directly to a bug to track our community bug
backlog when the bug meets the following criteria. When the bug no longer meets
these criteria, we unsubscribe it:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Anything that, if the bug turns out to be valid, is something that would be
under the <em>~ubuntu-server</em> remit to fix (common use cases but not obscure

<li>This subscription is for the Ubuntu Server triage community and is not for

<h3>Tagging <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-next</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#tagging-server-next" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since the backlog is bigger than what can be achieved in a short time, there is
the extra classification via the tag <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-next</span></code>. That tag is set by the
Triager (or anyone else working on doing the Root-Cause-Analysis or a Fix) to
reflect that this is an issue that shall be tackled by the Teams resources
“next”.</p>
<p>Another reason to add <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-next</span></code> in some cases is to preserve high quality
contributions of the community. An example might be a report that the user
already bisected and created a patch for - in those cases the benefit
diminishes by bit rot way too fast, so handling that next helps to retain the
work the reporters did. And vice versa it might encourage one or the other to
provide more high quality bugs.</p>
<p>The goal is to have this list around ~20 bugs most of the time, if dropping
below we can refill with candidates from the <em>~ubuntu-server</em> subscribed bugs.
But if it grows significantly out of this range it is non-realistic to expect
those issues to be handled in time, we should communicate so to the reporters.</p>
<p>The rules of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-next</span></code> tag are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Must not tag unless bug is actionable. Doesn’t mean it must have a patch,
only that a developer has enough information to work on the bug, even if it
means more debugging.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Tag only if one of these two things are true:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Delays will discourage this excellent community contribution.</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>If you believe it affects a major use case for Ubuntu server users. In</dt>
<dd>this case you should also set the bug Importance.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The set of all bugs tagged <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-next</span></code> must be kept small. If it grows,
the lowest priority bugs tagged <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-next</span></code> must be removed until the
list isn’t too big.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">This tag is for the Ubuntu Server triage community and is not for tracking
of internal Canonical customer requests. Whether a Canonical customer has
made a request in relation to a particular bug makes no difference and
provides no additional priority under this process. A Canonical customer bug
may still be tagged if it qualifies under these criteria.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If the bug is assigned to or otherwise owned by someone on our team, there

<h3>Tagging <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-todo</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#tagging-server-todo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is our new tag we use from now on to represent valid and work we should do
(better than just backlog), but not as important/easy/urgent as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-next</span></code></p>
<p>We want to assign bugs from this queue as well, just not as
urgently/desperately:</p>
<p>Definition to qualify for server-todo:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Whatever we think that we want to work on soon. For example:<ul>
<li>An important new technology for Ubuntu-Server users</li>
<li>Great community engagement that provide debugging and patches, but might be
too unimportant for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-next</span></code></li>
<li>OTOH we don’t want to put in bugs where the next step is significantly
larger than one day to complete, unless the bug is particularly important.
Examples:<ul>
<li>A feature that is Ubuntu only and important for our users -&gt; ok to be in
the list despite likely needing more time</li>
<li>A valid crash report, but being a corner case and having just one

<div class="section" id="daily-bug-expiration">
<h3>Daily Bug Expiration<a class="headerlink" href="#daily-bug-expiration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are two levels of expiration. The tooling will help to report these to
the Triager.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Server-next expiration (default after <strong>60 days</strong>)</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If we considered a bug actionable and added it to server-next, but then no
update happened in 60 days that usually means something went wrong. Often
bugs are blocked on external constraints. This needs to be evaluated as a
case-by-case decision. Most common cases are, that it turns out:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>that the bug is not solvable/reasonable the way it was planned -&gt;
re-triage, maybe drop server-next.</li>
<li>that it is actually fixed or otherwise progressed without update -&gt; update
bug</li>
<li>that we failed to give it the required focus -&gt; add the
server-triage-discuss tag to the bug and bring it in the next standup</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Server subscription expiration (default after <strong>180 days</strong>)</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If nobody touched a bug for 180 days (~= 1 release cycle) it is reasonable to
check for changed conditions. Quite often e.g. a patch one was waiting on is
available now. In other cases a newer release fixed it already. Essentially
anything that is listed here needs to be fully re-triaged to ensure the list
is reflecting the current status. It also can after this time be used as a
metric how many more people chimed in got dupped on the bug
(importance/#affected). Most common cases are, that it turns out:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>that recent releases upstream or even already in Ubuntu have the fix -&gt;
re-triage, consider tagging <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-next</span></code> for SRU</li>
<li>that the bug should have been supported by the community but nothing
happened -&gt; re-triage importance, consider dropping <em>~ubuntu-server</em>
subscription</li>
<li>that a bug that was formerly considered a real case is not qualifying
anymore (e.g. alternative solutions have taken hold as <em>the</em> way to do it)
-&gt; re-triage importance, consider dropping <em>~ubuntu-server</em> subscription</li>
<li>If unsure, add the server-triage-discuss tag and bring it up at the next
standup</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Overall for all of these we have to be honest to the bug reporter, try to
understand why an issue was not worked on and explain it if possible. Also if
we drop <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-next</span></code> or the <em>~ubuntu-server</em> subscription for any of the
reasons above always add a explanatory comment. If reporters disagree with our
re-triage they will report on the bug and it will show up in the daily triage
duty the next day to be reconsidered with that point of view taken into
consideration.</p>

<div class="section" id="awareness-of-the-triage">
<h2>Awareness of the Triage<a class="headerlink" href="#awareness-of-the-triage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have several stakeholders we want to keep up-to-date on things that we’ve
found on triage. On one hand we want to keep the community generally informed
as well as raising issues within the team to ensure they are not falling
through the cracks.</p>
<p>For the community we send a mail to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:ubuntu-server&#37;&#52;&#48;lists&#46;ubuntu&#46;com">ubuntu-server<span>&#64;</span>lists<span>&#46;</span>ubuntu<span>&#46;</span>com</a> that
summarizes how many bugs we’ve triaged and touches on the noteworthy cases.
This can also be used to CC additional people that (for case specific reasons)
should be aware of a case. An example of that would be if a security fix caused
an upgrade-regression which would make us CC the uploader and/or
ubuntu-security.</p>
<p>Furthermore on cases that need immediate attention or at least awareness we
might:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bring them up in the daily standup (mostly if they need a discussion/decision
that one can’t do alone)</li>
<li>Ping a subject matter expert via IRC/Mattermost</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases a package maintainer might already be aware and follow a case. To
avoid endless re-pings on such a case the agreement is that if the maintainer
is personally subscribed (i.e. with his launchpad user, not just indirectly via
teams like <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-virt">Ubuntu Virtualisation</a>) then we consider the maintainer to be
aware and will not do extra pings/mentions/CC.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="triage-rotation">
<h2>Triage Rotation<a class="headerlink" href="#triage-rotation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>According to load we might shift things, but generally every day Tue-Fri has a
team member assigned. Monday is often more work and includes more low quality
bugs as it includes all of the weekend - therefore Monday is a rotation through
all eligible bug triagers. This is organized internally in the teams Jira and
automation will create a Task with the “bug-triage” label assigned to the
person on rotation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tooling">
<h2>Tooling<a class="headerlink" href="#tooling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://snapcraft.io/ustriage">ustriage</a> tool is available as a snap and serves as the tool a triager
would use. It is maintained publicly on github as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-server-triage">ubuntu server triage</a>. It
has options to identify bugs for the triage of the day as well as serving as a
helper to check our tagged bugs ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks.
The Readme.md of the linked project has some more details and use case example.</p>
