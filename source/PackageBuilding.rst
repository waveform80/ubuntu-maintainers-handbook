Package Building
================

There are multiple ways to build a package, each with advantages and
disadvantages. Which one you choose will depend on your circumstances.

Note: git-ubuntu no longer supports the build argument (neither for source nor
for binary builds).


Downloading the orig tarball (optional)
=======================================

If you intend to use more manual methods like ``sbuild`` or
``dpkg-buildpackage`` directly, you will probably have to download the orig
tarball first.  You can do so by using::

    $ git ubuntu export-orig

It will try to use the ``pristine-tar`` branch to generate the tarball (and will
likely fail), and then it will fallback to downloading the tarball directly
from Launchpad.  When it finishes, you should be able to see a link to the orig
tarball at ``../``.

Building Source Packages
========================

Using dpkg-buildpackage
-----------------------

This method will directly install any dependencies it needs to build, so it's
recommended to create an LXD container to do the build. Replace ``focal`` with
the container image you wish to use.

From within the package repository::

    $ lxc launch images:ubuntu/focal builder &&
      sleep 5 &&
      lxc exec builder -- mkdir -p /root/build/package &&
      tar cf - . | lxc exec builder -- tar xf - -C /root/build/package &&
      lxc exec builder -- sh -c 'apt update &&
      apt dist-upgrade -y &&
      apt install -y ubuntu-dev-tools &&
      cd /root/build &&
      pull-debian-source -d $(grep "Source: " package/debian/control | sed "s/Source: \(.*\)/\1/g") $(grep "unstable; urgency=" package/debian/changelog |grep -v ubuntu|head -1|sed "s/.*(\(.*\)).*/\1/g") &&
      cd /root/build/package &&
      apt build-dep -y ./ &&
      dpkg-buildpackage -S' &&
      lxc exec builder -- tar cf - --exclude=package -C /root/build . | tar xf - -C .. &&
    $ lxc delete -f builder

Even though the recommended way to build a source package is to use a pristine
environment inside an LXD container, you can also use ``dpkg-buildpackage``'s
``--no-check-builddeps`` option and build the source package locally::

    $ dpkg-buildpackage -S -d


Signing the Changes File
------------------------

In order for a source package to be accepted by Launchpad, it must be signed.
You can sign it manually with ``debsign`` (within the package folder)::

    debsign ../$( grep "Source: " debian/control | sed "s/Source: \(.*\)/\1/g")_$(grep "urgency=" debian/changelog | head -1 | sed "s/.*(\(.*\)).*/\1/g")_source.changes


Building Binary Packages
========================

Using sbuild
------------

Assuming you have configured ``sbuild`` properly, you can use it to build the
binary package::

    $ sbuild

Because of https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/1699763, it is a good idea
to disable the inclusion of ``.buildinfo`` files in the ``*_source.changes``
file::

    $ sbuild --debbuildopts='--buildinfo-option=-O'


As a PPA in Launchpad
---------------------

Launchpad can build binary packages from your signed source packages and store
them in PPA archives. This is especially useful because reviewers of your merge
proposal will have a ready binary to test from. The disadvantage is that during
busy times, it can take awhile for your package to come up in the build queue.


Set the Version String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the PPA, we need to change the version in the changelog that's lower than
the version we plan to release. Since the tilde ``~`` character sorts lower
than everything else in launchpad, we can simply append ``~ppa1`` to the
version string in ``debian/changelog``. For example::

    -postfix (3.3.0-1ubuntu0.1) bionic; urgency=medium
    +postfix (3.3.0-1ubuntu0.1~ppa1) bionic; urgency=medium

.. note::

  The command below can be used to modify the version for PPA usage::

      sed -i "s/\($(grep "urgency=" debian/changelog|head -1|sed "s/.*(\(.*\)).*/\1/g")\)/\1~ppa1/g" debian/changelog

.. note::

  If a PPA is used to build the package and the version string was changed like
  above, once needs to rerun dpkg-buildpackage -S -d.


Create the PPA archive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to your launchpad page (https://launchpad.net/~your-username) and click
"Create a new PPA". Give it a name such that you'll remember what it's about in
a few months. A useful form is ``package-type-lpbug-description``:

For example:

URL
  postfix-sru-lp1753470-segfault

Display name
  postfix-fix-lp1753470-segfault

Description
  (leave it empty)

Now click "Activate".

It is also helpful to enable all architectures to ensure no build regressions
were introduced. Do so by clicking on ``Change Details`` in the newly created
PPA page, and then selecting the other architectures.

Upload the source package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ dput ppa:kstenerud/postfix-sru-lp1753470-segfault ../bionic-postfix_3.3.0-1ubuntu0.1~ppa1_source.changes

When it finishes, you should be able to see it e.g.
https://launchpad.net/~kstenerud/+archive/ubuntu/postfix-postconf-segfault-1753470/+packages

.. note::

  You must wait for the package to build server-side before you can use the PPA
  to install packages. This might take time depending on how busy things are!
  Launchpad also sends status updates notification mails, so monitor your
  inbox.
