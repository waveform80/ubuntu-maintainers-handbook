========================
Merge Proposal Reviewing
========================

 check formal content (changelog, patch naming, version numbers, patch headers, ...)

Initial Review
==============

Check the changelog header
--------------------------

* Follows dep-3 http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep3/
* Contains bug pointer (LP: #12345678)
* Proper version change
* Proper distribution
* Lists all files changed
* Proper author & email

Check the commits
-----------------

* Changes are logically split into separate commits
* changelog is the last commit

Check the files
---------------

* Only files inside the debian directory have been modified

Review Template
===============

The following template may come useful when submitting reviews::

    * Changelog:
      - [ ] old content and logical tag match as expected
      - [ ] changelog entry correct version and targeted codename
      - [ ] changelog entries correct
      - [ ] update-maintainer has been run

    * Actual changes:
      - [ ] no upstream changes to consider
      - [ ] no further upstream version to consider
      - [ ] debian changes look safe

    * Old Delta:
      - [ ] dropped changes are ok to be dropped
      - [ ] nothing else to drop
      - [ ] changes forwarded upstream/debian (if appropriate)

    * New Delta:
      - [ ] no new patches added
      - [ ] patches match what was proposed upstream
      - [ ] patches correctly included in debian/patches/series
      - [ ] patches have correct DEP3 metadata

    * Build/Test:
      - [ ] build is ok
      - [ ] verified PPA package installs/uninstalls
      - [ ] autopkgtest against the PPA package passes
      - [ ] sanity checks test fine
